### Superpower Product Inventory App ###

# Project Brief:

The purpose of this app is to allow a "superpower" shop owner to track their shop's inventory. This is an admin/management app, created for the shop owner and staff members to manage their product stock levels. 

- The inventory tracks individual products - using their name, description, stock quantity, buying cost and selling price.
- The inventory tracks manufacturers - using their name, email address and location. 

# Key features:
- Products and manufacturers can be created separately - (CREATE)
- Products and manufacturers can be edited separately - (UPDATE and DELETE)
- An inventory page will be shown, displaying all of the products in a single view.
- The app displays the stock quantity as an integer and also highlights "low stock" in yellow and "out of stock" in red to the user.

# Main technologies used to create app:
- Python
- Flask
- SQL

# Design patterns/models used:
